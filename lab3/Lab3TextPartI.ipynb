    "Suppose that $y_i$ is your class label (in this case $y_i$ is either 0 or 1 for negative and positive). $i$ just indexes what datapoint you're looking at. We'll say that $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$ (in other words you have $N$ sentences in your training dataset).\n",

    "Naive Bayes models the joint probability density, $p(y_i, \\mathbf{x}_i)$. We do this by parameterizing the prior probability of having a certain class, and then parameterizing the probability of generating a certain sentence given that class. Using Bayes rule, we can write this as:\n",

    "where $x_{it}$ is the word at position $t$, and $T_i$ is the length of sentence $i$. Now we apply a huge assumption (which seems like it is just wrong, but works decently in practice). That is, we assume that $x_{i1},\\dots,x_{iT_i}$ are conditionally independent given the class, $y_i$. This lets us factor the probability as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(y_i, \\mathbf{x}_i) = p(y_i)\\prod_{t=1}^T p(x_{it}| y_i)  $$ \n",

    "$$p(x_{it} = dog | y_i = 0) =  \\pi_{0,dog} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\pi_{0,dog}$ is the probability that \"dog\" is generated given that we're in class 0 (negative). So we need 2*Vocab_size parameters for this, since we need a probability for every class for every word. For the english language, that's approximately 20,000 parameters. Also, we parameterize the prior probabilites as bernoulli random variables. That's only one extra parameter:\n",

    "Given this model, it's pretty straightforward to get a maximum likelihood estimate for all the parameters, i.e. the $\\theta$s and $\\pi$s. If you're not familiar with maximum likelihood, it just means that we choose $\\theta$ and $\\pi$s to be the values that make the observed data have the highest likelihood. This turns the learning procedure into a simple optimization problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we go through all the math to solve this, it actually turns out that we get:\n",
    "optimal $\\theta_0$ is the proportion of sentences that are in class $0$, the negative class, and that $\\pi_{0,dog}$ is just the proportion of words in class $0$ that are the word \"dog\". Likewise, $\\pi_{1,dog}$ is just the proportion of words in class $1$ that are the word \"dog\". \n",
