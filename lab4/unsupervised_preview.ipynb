    "Unsupervised learning consists of the set of statistical tools that are used in the setting in which we have only a set of $p$ features measured on $n$ observations, but we do not have an associated response variable $Y$ - that is, there are no training labels. The goal is to discover interesting things about the measurements on $X_1, X_2,\\dots, X_p$. The two main types of unsupervised are clustering and dimensionality reduction. We will focus on two types of clustering, k-means and hierarchical clustering, as well as the dimensionality tool principal components analysis, which is widely used for preprocessing and data visualization.

Specifically, we want to find clusters, groups within our object set where objects in a cluster are more similar to each other than they are to objects outside of the cluster. Note that this definition is quite vague - there are many different ways to conceptualize how clusters may occur in data, and today we will look at K-Means and hierarchical clustering in particular."

    "K-Means is one of the most common and simple clustering methods, but it has a couple of key limitations. First off, it is nondeterministic as it depends on the initial choice of cluster means, and Lloyd's Algorithm only arrives upon local minima rather than the global minimum. Furthermore, the algorithm requires you to decide what $k$ is, as we saw earlier. Finally, K-Means can be inflexible, as the only way cluster centers are derived is through the mean distance from all of the points assigned to the cluster. Because of this construction, K-Means doesn't perform well on clusters that are connected but not compact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering solves many of these issues. The motivation between hierarchical clustering is building up clusters as a hierarchy. All objects start out in their individual groups, and at each level, the groups that are a certain distance apart are joined to form a larger group. A variety of different distance metrics can be used in building up these groups to result in different types of hierarchical clusters. \n",

Suppose our row vectors are $\\alpha_i$, and suppose furthermore that they're orthonormal (orthogonality is crucial because we want as efficient a subspace as possible, and normality doesn't change our ability to explain the results). Then, the amount of *stuff in $x_i$* that can't be explained by the subspace is:\n",

If 90% of the total sum of the eigenvalues is contributed by a few variables, those variables might be a good idea to keep, while dropping the rest. "
